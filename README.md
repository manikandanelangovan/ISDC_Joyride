# ISDC_Joyride
The project that required to write a function that implements the correct sequence of steps to parallel park a vehicle.

Part One - Drag Race: In this part you'll write code that lets a car jump over a grove of trees. This might not be a common scenario for a self driving car but it will get you familiar with the programming interface. 
Part Two - Circular Track: You'll write code that lets a car navigate a circular track. In doing so you'll explore the relationship between steering angle and turning radius. 
Part Three - Parallel Park: In this part you'll write a sequence of instructions that successfully parallel parks a car.
